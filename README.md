# Godot 3.2 beta experiment: a simple dialogue system

Inspired from [this blog post](https://joecreager.com/how-i-made-a-simple-dialogue-system-with-godot/), I made a short visual
novel with its instruction of making a simple dialogue
system. 

Since the version of the engine I am using is beta and still
in middle of WIP, I won't recommend to export the finished
result.
